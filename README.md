# Skill Distillery Week 13 Project

## Creating a Single-Page Event Tracker using jQuery and REST

### Project Overview
- Allow the user to track their progress as they venture from land to land defeating bigger and badder foes.

- The user may view the amount of Gold they've amassed by selecting the "Gold Obtained" header. This statistic displays
by default.

- The user may also check to see how many Foes they've defeated by selecting the "Foes Defeated" header.

- If the user is interested in seeing how many Lands they've been to, they can select the "Land Where Encountered" header.

- The user may click directly on the name of a fallen foe to see an image of their opponent as well as a brief description.

- The user may also click directly on the name of an area they've been to and see an image of the location along with 
a short synopsis describing the area. 

- The user may delete any quests they no longer want to track by clicking the "Purge" option in that quest's table row.

- If the user would like to revise details of a certain quest, they may select the "Revise" option for that particular
adventure. They will then be shown a form with all of the quest's data pre filled in.

- Finally, the user may add new quests to their itinerary. 
  - They will be allowed to enter the name of the foe they encountered 
  along with a brief description of their opponent and an image of their choosing (in the form of a URL).
  - They will also be allowed to enter how much gold they obtained along with any loot (weapons, rings, spells, etc).
  - Finally, they may enter the land they traveled to. If the land is one the user has already traveled to, the program
  will fill in any missing data with what has already been stored in the database. If the user wishes to revise this data,
  they may do so and these changed will persist for all quests in that particular land.

- If at any point the user wishes to return to their list of quests, they can select the "Quest Tracker" option in
the nav-bar.
  
### Stumbling Blocks
 - CSS remains one of my biggest stumbling blocks. While the program looks presentable, I wish I was able to do
 more with the styling to make it look more professional.
 
### Goals For The Future
 - I would like to add on to the "Loot" feature of this program, allowing the user to enter in multiple items when 
 adding a new quest. Additionally, I would like to allow the user to edit these items and delete them. Perhaps I could 
 implement a viewing feature similar to the ones used for Foes and Land.
